        <p>Temtem is a MMORPG Monster Capture game set in the fictional world of the Airborne Archipelago, a diverse
          collection of six islands orbiting a flaming orb called the PanSun. In this world, humans coexist with Temtem,
          unique and powerful creatures native to the Archipelago. The game is set in a newly emerging technological era
          for the Archipelago, where the convenient storage of Temtem, in devices called TemCards, is making Taming and
          Battling easier than ever before.</p>
        <p>The player enters this world on the eve of their apprenticeship to the esteemed Professor Konstantinos, where
          they are granted their very own Temtem to begin their adventure as a Temtem Tamer. Once received, the player
          is set free to leave their home town of Zadar and journey through the expansive Archipelago, exploring the
          world of Temtem and facing whatever challenges that may bring.</p>

      <header>Temtem Types</header>
      <article>
        <p>Types are properties of Temtem and their techniques. Each type confers a specific array of strengths and
          weaknesses against other types. Each Temtem can have up to two types, while techniques can only have one type.
          The typing of a Temtem determines whether that Temtem will take more or less damage from a technique of a
          specific type, whereas the type of a technique indicates its effectiveness against a targeted Temtem.</p>
        <p>There is a total of 12 different types in Temtem:</p>
        <code>Neutral Type</code><br>
        <code>Fire Type</code><br>
        <code>Nature Type</code><br>
        <code>Water Type</code><br>
        <code>Electric Type</code><br>
        <code>Mental Type</code><br>
        <code>Earth Type</code><br>
        <code>Wind Type</code><br>
        <code>Crystal Type</code><br>
        <code>Melee Type</code><br>
        <code>Toxic Type</code>
        <p>Each type can be strong when used against Temtem of certain types, weak when fared against others, or
          impartial. Very effective hits do x2 damage, neutral hits do x1 damage, and ineffective hits do x0.5 damage.
          Because Temtem may have two types, both have to be taken into consideration for the effectiveness of an
          attack. This way, a technique with a type that would be very effective against both types of a Temtem causes
          x4 the normal damage; a move that is ineffective against both types of a Temtem makes x0.25 damage; and an
          attack that is both very effective against one of the types and ineffective to the other neutralizes the hit
          to deal normal damage, x1. Below is the full type chart for each type's individual effectiveness against
          itself and its counterparts.</p>
        <p>A defending Temtem is considered to have a "weakness" to a certain type if the damage multiplier against it
          is greater than 1x, and is said to have a "resistance" if the multiplier is less than 1x. For example, the
          fire type has a weakness to the water type, because water moves do 2x damage to fire types. In return, water
          has a resistance to fire because fire moves used against water Temtem have a damage multiplier of 0.5x.
          Combining different types together can affect these weaknesses and resistances, sometimes making them more
          extreme and sometimes cancelling them out altogether. Below is a full table of the number of weaknesses and
          resistances for each possible dual type combination, as well as a count of the number of Temtem that have been
          announced to have that particular type combination.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Temtem battles are the form of competition between tamers or wild Temtems in the Airborne Archipelago. Tamers
          can have up to six Temtem in their squad, but only two at a time will be able to battle. In Temtem, battles
          are turn-based, so tamers will take turns commanding their Temtem in battle until all Temtem on the opposing
          side are exhausted and the team emerges as the winner.</p>
        <p>Battles are focused on 2v2 (although there will be some 2v1 battles against untamed Temtem or 1v1 battles
          with other players). Notably, very little RNG is used in Temtem battles compared to other games of the same
          genre. Fights can be found in tall grass, caves, water or by approaching Tamers found while exploring. You can
          also challenge other players.</p>
        <p>Your squad is the selection of Temtem you actively hold. It can be accessed through your character settings
          and can hold up to six Temtem at any given point. Whichever order your squad is in, is what will be
          prioritized during combat. You can edit your squad at any Temporium, where you will be able to see all your
          captured Temtems.</p>
        <p>There are a series of components to keep in mind in battle. Levels will indicate how strong your Temtem is in
          battle. Certain Temtems will start off with, or will learn, a variety of traits. These will allow your Temtem
          to have various benefits in battle. Your Temtems traits can be viewed by clicking your Temtem in the squad
          screen.</p>
        <p>Temtems have different health stats, which can be restored between fights using Balm, Temessence Vial, or at
          any Temporium. If a Temtem takes damage during a fight, the damage will not be restored after the fight is
          over. Should all your Temtem faint, you will automatically be transported to the most recently visited
          Temporium, for a varying price of Pansun.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Quests are related tasks given to the player. Quests are split into two categories:</p>
        <p><strong>Main Quests</strong> are quests that drive the central narrative of the game. They unlock new
          content, such as permitting the player to travel to previously inaccessible area. Main quests are sequential
          and require completion of the previous main quest to begin.</p>
        <p><strong>Side Quests</strong> are optional tasks that have no direct bearing on the progression of the main
          plot and can be completed at the players discretion. Completing side quests rewards the player with all sorts
          of different rewards such as healing items or new pieces of gear.</p>

      <header>Airborne Archipelago</header>
      <article>
        <p>The Archipelago is composed of six main islands, gravitationally locked in slow rotation around the flaming
          orb called the Pan-Sun. Blessed by its light and warmth, humans and Temtem coexist peacefully in this floating
          Archipelago. Nobody has ever returned from the depths of Downbelow and nothing is known for sure about the
          cloudy Highabove – so this is the extent of the known world.</p>
        <p>Before the invention of airships, islands were almost completely isolated, and during those centuries very
          different cultures evolved on each one of the islands. Travel between the islands is now made mainly by
          airships. Find a short-list of the islands below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deniz</strong> is a Mediterranean paradise of glittering seas where Water and Wind Temtem abound.
            Walk the streets of Turquesa, explore the ruins of an ancient fort or just chill on the shores of Indigo
            Lake.</li>
          <li><strong>Omninesia</strong> (”the Myrisles”), is a cluster of tropical islets connected by rope bridges,
            home of Nature and Fire Temtem. Enjoy the luxury of Atoll Row and investigate the lava caves of the Anak
            volcano.</li>
          <li><strong>Arbury</strong>’s pride is its University. The fierce dons of Lochburg swear by their Melee
            Temtem, against the sophisticated Properton academics, who favour Mental Temtem.</li>
          <li><strong>Cipanku</strong> dabbles in mysticism and technology. The labs of Nanto produce Digital Temtem,
            while the monks revere the Electric Temtem in remote hills among rice paddies.</li>
          <li><strong>Tucma</strong>, “The End of All Things” – a vast desolation of ashes, noxious lakes and Toxic
            Temtem. Under the surface, the mining city of Quetzal is home to artisans, rock-hoppers and Crystal Temtem.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Kisiwa</strong> is a sun-drenched savanna. Eastern Kisiwa boasts an unrivalled variety of Neutral
            Temtem, while the western deserts are home to the best Earth Temtem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Pan-Sun in the center of the Archipelago is partially covered by rocks. These rocks block the sunlight,
          creating a day and night cycle that differs between each island.</p>
